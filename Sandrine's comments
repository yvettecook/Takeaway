## Suggestions for further refactoring:
  - Menu: why not add instances of dishes directly instead of adding the dish names and prices separately (DNRY)?
  - Order: likewise, could be shorter to link to a customer rather than setting customer name and phone as separate attributes
    + instead of adding dish name, price and quantity separately to create an order, why not use instances of line items?
    Then, the order's grand total could be calculated more directly, as the sum of each line item total, instead of having to create the method get_total?
  
## Other comments:
  - Customer's CRC card says it has an address, but there is no address in the code
  - Line item: has no information about the dish itself, only price and quantity. 
  Price being an attribute of dish, why not use dish and quantity as attributes of Line item?
